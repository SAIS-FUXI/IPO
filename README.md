This repo contains IPO pre-trained weights, training/sampling code, for our paperIPO: Iterative Preference Optimization for Text-to-Video Generation.

## News
- (ðŸ”¥ New) ```2025/2/26```ðŸ’¥: We open source our model after post-training using the IPO method on 5B, **IPOC-5B-v1.0ï¼Œand we use more data to train the reward model after optimization.
